## 📌 About
This project is a high-performance personal portfolio website designed to showcase projects, skills, and professional experience. Deviating from traditional linear layouts, it utilizes a **Bento Grid** architecture to present information in a modular, data-dense, and visually engaging "Command Center" style.

The interface prioritizes **speed and tactile feedback**, featuring a custom interaction system that feels snappy and responsive.

## ✨ Key Features
- **Bento Grid Layout**: A responsive, grid-based dashboard interface inspired by modern operating systems and Apple's UI philosophy.
- **Micro-Interactions v8**: A custom "Snappy & Tactile" interaction model featuring 150ms transitions, 4px lift, and zero-latency feedback.
- **Semantic Coloring**: Interactive elements provide context-aware color feedback (e.g., Gold for Awards, Violet for Web Projects).
- **Responsive Design**: Seamlessly adapts from wide-screen desktop layouts to optimized mobile stacks.
- **Live Widgets**: Includes functional widgets for Developer Jokes, Status indicators, and interactive terminal simulations.
